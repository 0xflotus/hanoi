Introduction:

Hanoi is a C99 library for exotic binary based number systems. It is named after the tower of Hanoi puzzle, which is itself an exotic number system. It includes a Python/C++ based testing library with python reference implementations.

This library is intended for fun, experimental mathematics and perhaps niche use cases.



Supported number systems:
- Negabinary (base -2)
- Binarions (base -1+i) (See: "A binary system for complex numbers" - Walter Penney)
- Base Fibonacci
- Stern-Brocot rationals
